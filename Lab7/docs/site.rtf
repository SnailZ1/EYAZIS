The site had previously been a field, and all of the trees there were added as part of Kiley's landscape design.[12] Two parallel rows of maple trees, planted in the shape of offset dashed lines, run along Tipton Lane on the southern boundary of the site.[10] The maple trees form an allée that surrounds the property.[27][18] The entrances on the western and eastern elevations are flanked by dwarf crabapple trees.[10][12] Adjoining the northern and southern elevations, the moats have myrtle trees, and there is a magnolia grove beyond. The berms on these elevations have grass plantings, which replaced the original cotoneaster and yew plants.[10] Kiley's landscape design retained some trees on the easternmost part of the site, which already existed when the church building was built.[30]
Early plans called for memorial plaques to be embedded into the berm, with each plaque honoring a deceased congregant.[26][23] Southeast of the church building is a memorial garden planted in 1995,[24][18] with 43 trees representing the original members of the congregation.[18] The garden, designed by Todd Williams, contains wooden plaques and a bench. The original plans called for a sculpture and a wall made of slate, which were never built.[24]
